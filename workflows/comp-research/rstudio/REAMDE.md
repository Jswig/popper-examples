# RStudio workflow example

Anders Poirel

This is workflow developed for the [Flu Shot Learning](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/) 
machine learning competition on Driven Data. The competition's goal is to predict how
 likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and. Specifically, participants are asked 
 to predict a probability for each vaccine. Participants are ranked the 
 [ROC AUC score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) of their
  predictions on a hold-out test set.
