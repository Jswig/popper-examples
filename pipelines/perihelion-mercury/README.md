# perihelion-mercury

Popper pipeline that emulates the perihelion motion of Mercury caused by General Relativity.
This pipeline was `poperized` from here:

https://github.com/ckoerber/perihelion-mercury
`

In this case, popper makes use of virtualenv to install all the required dependencies and
executes the scripts [`base_solution.py`](./py-scripts/base_solution.py) and 
[`perihelion.py`](./py-scripts/perihelion.py) automatically.
