# validator
A template showing how to use Popper with validations.
In this case, Popper helps ensure that validations are enable by returning a gold when running the command: popper run.

A gold status is returned when all validations were true at the validate.sh stage. A validation is true if it has the next format:
> [true] Text about your validation.

false otherwise.
